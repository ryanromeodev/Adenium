# Plant App

Indoor plants🪴 are considered as the best hobby😊 nowadays due to the relaxation and peacefullness that the hobby offers. However since these plants are grown indoors, the poor little plants could not gain maximum sunlight☀️ and soil nutrients as compared to the outdoor ones. So it would be an integral part in providing these plants with regular and timed supply of food(soil nutrients) so as to ensure they grow healthy😁.

## Getting Started: How to feed the plants in a regular time interval?

Conventionally it would be better to Note down the dates in a calendar or something. However, there is no challenge and thigs might be cluttered there. On the other hand having an application which only deals with dedicated issues of feeding the plant is much better and efficient. The application not only arranges the data in a beautiful UI but also sorts📃 the plant which require food immediately on the top of the list and so on...
